## Dataset

Fortnite Battle Royale is nearing its one-year anniversary in September, but it has become one of the greatest video games that has ever been released. The best players in the game showcase their skills on live-streaming platforms like Twitch, Mixer and YouTube Gaming. The game has become so popular that even celebrities and professional athletes have joined in on the action. I want to gather the information on charity events that celebrity have participated in with Fortnite. 

Here are the features I'll be collecting, and an explanation of how:

- The color of Sanders' shirt or jacket (the outermost layer when there are multiple layers) (or N/A if Sanders did not conduct the press conference)
- The date of the press conference
- The time of the press conference (start time)
- The location of the press conference (I'm curious whether this makes any difference - does she dress differently in the press room than elsewhere?)
- The outdoor temperature at the time of the press conference (this might be a counfounding factor, for example if she is more likely to be wearing a winter jacket)
- A list of other people who spoke from the podium at the press conference, separated by semicolons
- A link to an image of Sanders at the press conference from one of the following news sources: NYT, WaPo, WSJ, Politico, CNN, CSPAN.

I will collect the data by watching part of the press conference and recording this information. I will use weather.gov to find the temperature in the city where the press conference is taking place. I will find the image by looking at the news sources cited above.
