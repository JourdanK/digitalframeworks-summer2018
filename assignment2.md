## Dataset

Fortnite Battle Royale is nearing its one-year anniversary in September, but it has become one of the greatest video games that has ever been released. The best players in the game showcase their skills on live-streaming platforms like Twitch, Mixer and YouTube Gaming. The game has become so popular that even celebrities and professional athletes have joined in on the action. I want to gather the information on charity events that celebrity have participated in with Fortnite. 

Here are the features I'll be collecting, and an explanation of how:

- Name of the charity event
- Who the event was hosted by
- Name of the celebrity/professional athletes in attendance
- The date of the event
- The peak concurrent viewers that watched the event (if streamed)
- The location of the event (curious to know which US region hosts the most events) 
- A list of other streamers that participated in the event
- The person (or team) that won the event
- A link to a story about the event from a reputable source

I will collect the data by scavengering the information on the Internet, as well as review the previous streams that showcase the celebrity events.
