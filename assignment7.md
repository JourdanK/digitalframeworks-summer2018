According to the FEC, I found that NFLPA's first political donations lean on the side of Republican candidates for Congress. 

To complete this story, I would examine the total number of donations made by current NFL players and how the money from them is being used by the NFLPA. I would also be interested in talking with the attorney who made a donation to the PAC because he is the most recent donation this year and the only one who isn't a football player. Why is the bulk of the money going to Republican candidates? 

In order to find my story, I did the following:

1. Searched the FEC for "Tom Brady" to see if he donated to any causes.
1. Found the NFLPA page and began to look at the disbursements to certain organizations.
1. Researched each of the parties for the respective campaigns (4 republicans, 2 democrats)
1. Current cash on hand for the organization is $695,460.56.

Headline: NFLPA Politicial Donations Favor Republicans, Nearly Double Amount to Democrats 

Nut graf: In February Tom Brady and other NFL players announced a decision to become more deeply involved with the political system through the NFLPA One Team PAC. Players from across the League donated between $225 and $5000, adding up to over $700,000. 

According to the Federal Election Commission, the initial disbursement of $27,700 in May went in large part to Republican Congressional candidates.
