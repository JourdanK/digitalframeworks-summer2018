HEADLINE: The next big sports curse is upon us, relates to popular basketball game

Sports fans have become no stranger to curses: The Curse of the Billy Goat (Chicago Cubs), the Curse of the Honey Bears (Chicago Bears), The Based God “Lil B” Curse, and many others. When the Cubs won the 2016 World Series, the 71-year Curse of the Billy Goat was lifted with the team earning the title. 

Many sports franchises, such as the Bears, have not found fortune like the Cubs. This has become even more relevant within the gaming industry.

Video games in the sports genre have been plagued to their own version of curses, dating back to 1999 when EA Sports “Madden NFL” series began placing the best football players on the cover of the popular game. 

Garrison Hearst was the first “Madden” cover athlete, and he ended up breaking his ankle. Barry Sanders quickly retired in 1999 after being named as the cover athlete for “Madden 2000”. Eddie George, the choice for 2001, missed an important reception that cost the Titans their season. 

Tom Brady recently became the latest addition to the list of victims after Super Bowl LII. The future hall of fame quarterback was sacked and fumbled with the game on the line against Philadelphia, and as a result the Eagles scored. The Eagles won, and Brady’s fate was sealed, despite his best efforts to debunk the Madden curse.

Even though this curse does not directly relate to a specific NFL team, the key player’s decline in production ultimately impacted the team’s overall performance. However, it does not stop there for sports games. 

Take-Two Interactive’s popular basketball game “NBA 2K” debuted in 1999 and has been consistently released every year since then. For the first three iterations of the game, Allen Iverson graced the cover. 

In recent years, social media users have begun to examine the Curse of the “NBA 2K” Cover, and it relates to players leaving their current teams. When Kyrie Irving reportedly wanted to leave Cleveland, Florida Gators reporter Eric Fawcett tweeted the four most recent covers of “NBA 2K” and each of the players have departed their teams.

Almost every currently active player that was featured on the “NBA 2K” cover since 2008 has left his team at some point in the future. The curse revealed itself once again this summer with DeMar DeRozan’s departure from the Toronto Raptors.

Examining the last 10 years of “NBA 2K” covers, it becomes clear that there has become a trend. But not all players leave within one to three seasons. Some departures, such as Chris Paul, took over four seasons. 

NBA 2K8 (2007): After battling injury with New Orleans, Paul was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers in 2011.

NBA 2K13 (2012): Blake Griffin remained with the Los Angeles Clippers for five full additional seasons, following his cover debut. In January 2018, Griffin was traded to the Detroit Pistons to complete the 2017-18 season.

NBA 2K13 (2012): Derrick Rose found immediate success with the Chicago Bulls and stayed on the team for four more seasons after he was on the NBA 2K cover. He was traded to the Knicks in June 2016, had a short stint with the Cleveland Cavaliers, and now plays for the Minnesota Timberwolves.

NBA 2K14 (2013): LeBron James left the Miami Heat and goes back to the Cavs in 2014.

NBA 2K15 (2014): Kevin Durant left the Oklahoma City Thunder and goes to the Golden State Warriors in 2016. Two seasons earlier, Durant appeared on a version of NBA 2K13 cover.

NBA 2K17 (2016): Paul George left the Indiana Pacers and goes to the OKC Thunder in 2017.

NBA 2K18 (2017): Kyrie Irving was traded from the Cavs to the Boston Celtics before the game is released. 

NBA 2K18 – Canadian version (2017): DeRozan was traded to the San Antonio Spurs in a deal that brought Kawhi Leonard to the Raptors.

NOTE: NBA 2K9 through 2K12 featured retired basketball players – all of whom stayed with the same team throughout their entire career, except Kevin Garnett and Michael Jordan. 

There are only three currently active players – Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis and James Harden – that have remained with their cover team. In 2015, the standard version of NBA 2K16 featured all these players along with others on international versions of the game. 

A key accolade that each of these players shared at the time of their cover feature was the fact that they had been named an NBA All-Star, symbolizing what the significance of each player’s current at that point.  

Out of the eight players mentioned above, four willingly departed from their current team and four were traded following injury or as a front office decision. In the case of the most recen

Take-Two Interactive already announced that its next cover star would be Giannis Antetokounmpo, who immediately dismissed any rumors of an alleged NBA 2K cover curse tweeting #BuckForLife.

Antetokounmpo recently signed an extension with Milwaukee that would keep in with the team through the 2020-21 season. However, DeRozan also believed that he would stay with the Raptors for the remainder of his career.

According to the NPD Group, “NBA 2K18” was the highest-selling sports video game of 2017 and placed second behind Activision’s “Call of Duty: WWII” in overall sales for the year. In 2016, “NBA 2K17” ranked number four. “Madden NFL 18” sat two places behind in fourth and was the only other sports game to crack the top 10. 

NBA 2K gives gamers an opportunity to play as any NBA player offline or online against friends. The MyCareer mode in the game also gave players a chance to scan their face or use a pre-made character to work their way through a competitive league, similar to the rise of many famous basketball players. 

In the past, the game also provided special giveaways and perks for the best players in the world to win and be recognized on its one-of-a-kind NBA 2KTV.

The next title “NBA 2K19” debuts September 11 for the Standard Edition and the LeBron James’ 20th Anniversary Edition drops four days early on September 7.
