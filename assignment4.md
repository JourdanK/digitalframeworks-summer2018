# Final Project Pitch

The question that I will answer with my final project is to examine whether or not the NBA 2K Cover "curse" is real? Looking back at the last 10 years of NBA cover athletes (2K8-2K19), I want to study the facts and figures about where those athletes, who were all at the top of their game when selected, moved on or stayed once they were on the cover. 

To do this, I will use data on the following: 
  1. Salary range (high, low, average?)
  2. The player's years with team
  3. Stat averages(points per game, assists per game, rebounds per game, etc.) 
      - Mainly the stat lines that show the player's dominance in the League.
  4. Any accolades or awards that the player may have won with the team (MVP, Championship Titles, etc.)
  5. Did the player stay with that team after the team after the cover was released and how long?
  6. Reason the player was traded or left his team.

I could visualize a chart with different rows for a timeline with the correlations between the players. Basically, we could take a look at how the players align with one another with the circumstances surrounding their departure from the team. 

This is timely because of the upcoming release of the next NBA 2K game. DeMar DeRozan is the Canadian cover athlete for NBA 2K18, and he was recently traded as well. 

For sources, I plan to utilize the team websites and other reputable sports outlets -- NBA, ESPN, or Basketball Reference -- for statistical information. I could also talk to experts, potentially journalists at NABJ and afterward, who analyze the NBA and get background information from them.
