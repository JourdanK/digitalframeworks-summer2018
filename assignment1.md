### Objective: Clarity and accuracy

On a scale of 1-5, I would say that I was at about a four on what the reporters were trying to communicate. With the Fourth of July behind the country, they were trying to show how divided Americans were even when it came to Patriotism. Although that information was in the headline, I think it can be interpreted in different ways. The article even expresses that Democrats and Republicans look at certain elements of Patriotism differently. 

Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? 5.
I thought the first data graph was difficult to understand. I completely glanced over the gray labels at the bottom, so I don't think that was the best way to navigate the data. I would wonder, and possibly suggest, if a pie chart would be effective in that graph because visually I think it might make sense.
Using my own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, I'm a 4/5 on whether or not the data was accurate.
List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data.
 - I wonder what part of the country was polled.
 - I feel like the Democratic number could be higher, but it is not surprising the numbers that they have. 
 - Republicans "Not At All Patriotic" is interesting because I'm sure it's not a 0%. 
They provided sources for all of their data, as well as, they explained everything in detail. Background information and other content was also revealed. 

### Objective: Quality

I believe the story is a 4/5 on how it is presented to the viewer. The graphs stayed along the lines of patriotic colors and the style of the language is very easy to follow. I felt like anyone could read and follow along easily. I think that all of these tasks were definitely accomplished by the story. The Trump Approval and Generic Ballot information could have been left off because those kind of took away from the story I believe.

### Objective: Type and color

On a scale of 1-5, I would give type a 5. It is consistent throughout the piece. It's very easy to distinguish the headline from the rest of the text. 
On a scale of 1-5, I would give color a 3. The red and blue concept worked. I didn't like the green and orange on the Trump Approval because I just didn't get it. It felt like the Independents bar was lost on the second graphic. Although a small share of people are Independents, I still think the color should pop enough that it doesn't get lost in the graphic's grid. 

### Objective: Creativity

I think the creativity with the graphics is good (4/5). You could very well understand what the piece is trying to accomplish and say without reading the accompanying text story. They also used a variety of chart types, which I felt was a positive. I still think the last two sections could have been erased, however.
