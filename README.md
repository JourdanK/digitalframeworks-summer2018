# digitalframeworks-summer2018

### Jourdan's Last Quarter!!!
*From June - September, I will be taking digital frameworks with Sean McMinn. My hope by the end of the quarter is to be an expert data journalist.*

* I want to better execute data reporting. 
* I want to do more than just regular sports game stories.
